# Intermittent Firebase Function Failure: Race Condition with Database

This repository demonstrates a bug causing intermittent failures in a Firebase Cloud Function due to a race condition between function execution and concurrent database operations.

## Bug Description
A Firebase Cloud Function that interacts with the Firestore database experiences intermittent failures. The root cause is a race condition: the function attempts to access or modify data before a concurrent database operation completes, leading to unexpected behavior or errors.

## Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Set up a Firebase project and install dependencies.
3. Deploy the `bug.js` function to your Firebase project.
4. Trigger the function multiple times; you'll notice intermittent failures.

## Solution
The solution involves implementing proper synchronization mechanisms to prevent the race condition.  The corrected function is in `bugSolution.js` and uses a transaction to ensure atomicity.

## Bug and Solution Code
The `bug.js` file contains the faulty code exhibiting the race condition. The `bugSolution.js` file shows the corrected code using a Firestore transaction to resolve the issue.
